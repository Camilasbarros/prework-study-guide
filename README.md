# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Pre-Work Study Guide is a valuable tool for those who want to adequately prepare for a new job or project. Divided into sections dedicated to key topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, each section contains comprehensive and informative notes that cover the concepts and best practices related to each subject. This pre-work allows users to see directly how the code is executed and helps consolidate the knowledge gained during the pre-work study. As users go through the guide, the topics they have learned are listed, providing an overview of the progress made.
